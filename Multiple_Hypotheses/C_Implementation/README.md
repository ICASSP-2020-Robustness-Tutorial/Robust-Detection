### Build Requirements

C Math Library - \<math.h\>

GNU Scietific library (GSL), including development packages

CBLAS compatible BLAS library, such as OpenBLAS or ATLAS, including development packages

### Build

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Run '/build/tests/cfpd_tests' to check if everything works correctly.
